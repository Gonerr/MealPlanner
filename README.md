# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Overview

It is a web application for home meal planning that helps users organize their daily cooking decisions.
The application enables menu planning, recipe management, and automated shopping list generation.

## Technology Stack

### Core Framework

I used **React 19**, TypeScript for enhanced code reability and **React Router DOM 7** for navigation.

### State Management

Redux Toolkit 2.11.2 and React Redux 9.2.0 for bindings.

### UI Libraries

Bootstrap 5.3.8 with React Icons, also emotion for CSS-in-JS styling integration with MUI.

### Testing

Jest with React Testing Library, Chai 6.2.2 for assertions.

## Application Architecture 

The application follows a feature-based srtucture with clear separatuon of concernce.
Components are organized by feature rather than by type, promoting maintainability and scalability. The Redux store manages application state with typed slices, while custom hooks provide reusable logic across components.

## Key Features

The application provides a structured approach to meal planning with responsive design,
comprehensive state management, and modern UI components. The tech stack ensures type safety,
testability, and maintainable code architecture.
